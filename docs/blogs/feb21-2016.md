## Redis Caching
###### February 21, 2016

I've just implemented Redis caching of the markdown blog files this Node server reads from the file system. Even though it is overkill for this blog in it's current form, I wanted to get it out of the way early. I plan on adding several new features in the coming weeks including: tagging, search, pagination, etc. I felt introducing the caching now would be less of an investment than down the line. Plus, it was fun, and going to the file system to retrieve my blogs every time just felt dirty.

It's dead simple right now -- all it needs to be for a blog with only four entries. If a blog isn't in the cache, the markdown is fetched and the transformed HTML is hashed into Redis by the filename. If found, the fs fetch is skipped and the cache string is used. There is no invalidation or rotation at this point. Some time down the line I'll have to implement a way to rotate entries out. Some kind of LRU-ness or by stats on entries.
