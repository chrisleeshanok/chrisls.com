## Update \#3
###### February 18, 2016

More changes to the markdown parser module. I was able to remove the dependency for `async` by using native `Promise.all`.

I've also extracted the module into it's own repository, added tests, and published the module to npm. [batched-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/batched-markdown)!

The next step is speed up requests by cacheing the markdown output in Redis the first time they are read from the file system.
