## New Personal Website
###### February 15, 2016

Hello. If you've managed to find this page... Sorry for the mess! I'm the process of creating a new personal site with a simple blog engine that I am writing myself.

I didn't like what I saw out there in terms of pre-canned blog engines, so I decided to design one that meets my needs. I want to be able to write my entries in `markdown` and have the server serve static content. Few moving parts and low investment. And since my expertise lies with HTML/CSS/Javascript, I've decided to write it myself with the goal write as much by hand as possible. No frameworks and with as little front-end javascript as I can get away with. Everything will be rendered server-side.

As you can see, the basic core is working! This post is written in markdown. I'll soon be able to easily write blogs from my editor with snippets code like this:

    const test = (callback) => {
        if (!callback) {
            throw new Error('Callback required');
            return;
        }

        //Something
        callback();
    }

And as I commit to my Github repository, a deploy would refresh the blog with the new content. Why make it complicated?

I've been learning a lot lately so I figured it was time to create a space to share. I'll do a full writeup on the design of this blog when I'm finished.
